## 2016-11-10 2.0.0
### Summary
This release contains contains backwards incompatible parameter name and data
type changes.  Also here, is native Puppet 4 support, dropping Puppet 3
support, and lots of plumbing changes to make configuration validation a bit
cleaner.

#### Features
  - Drop Puppet 3.x support, leveraging native Puppet 4.x type validation
    - Validation change, VLAN IDs are now integers.
    - Validation change, address parameters are arrays.
  - The old 'values' param has been renamed to 'raw_values' to make it clear
    that the items will be written unmodified.
  - Library code has been much improved, centralizing the configuration
    validation between the BSDs to allow for easier addition of interface
    types, or future configuration changes.  The PuppetX::BSD::PuppetInterface
    parent class is now used to create a new interface type and provide the
    necessary validation.  This reduces the interface type specific code
    considerably.
  - 'network_key' has been renamed to 'wpa_key' on wifi interfaces
  - Add support for managing interface MTU

#### Bugfixes
  - Fix an issue where MTU is not properly read from the output of ifconfig
